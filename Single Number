    Given an array of integers, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.

    Note:
    Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it without using extra memory?
    
    do exclusive or twice will get the same thing
    and finally we do exclusive or for the mask(0, or whatever u want) second time, so only the number appear once will be left
