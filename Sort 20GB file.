Imagine you have a 20GB file with one string per line. Explain how you would sort the file.

Just like hadoop:

divide the file into several parts, like each part has 100 mega bytes. Then sort each of them in differenct machine. 
Finally, we merge them together. Basically it's like merge sort.

Standard solution: (concurrency system)
We will divide the file into several chunks, which has x megabytes each, where x is the amount of memory available. 
Each chunk/part are sorted separately, and then save back to the file system/ hard drive. 
Once all chunks are sortes, we merge them together, one by one. Finally, we get a fully sorted file.
